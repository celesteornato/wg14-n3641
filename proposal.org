+ *Proposal category*: Feature request
+ *Target audience*: Developers writing libraries
* Abstract
This proposal aims to add the ~[[assume(expr)]]~ and ~[[assume(expr, msg)]]~
attributes to function declarations, allowing the designer of a library to specify
statically-verifiable constraints in function parameters.

This features allows both for added safety on the caller side, and possibly for
further optimisation on the compiler side.

* Introduction
Inattention and forgetfulness cause developers to write insecure code.

If one wishes to convey to the user of a library that certain function parameters
can cause undefined or unwanted behaviour, they can only do so in written
documentation.  This leaves the developer in a precarious position: they can
either add checks at execution-time, which come with an unwanted performance
overhead and having to setup and document an error code system,
or they can assume that everyone will read the documentation, which may create
vulnerabilities.

This proposal seeks to make some of these checks possible without overhead, by implicitly
making static assertions before the function call.

This feature can be seen as an extension to the C99 ``static array index in
function parameters'' feature, in that it both allows for optimisations by the
compiler and for more compile-time checking for the user.

* Proposal
** Technical Description
When the attribute ~[[assume(expr)]]~ is associated to the declaration of a
function ~foo~, any call to ~foo~ will require the compiler to check that ~expr~
is *not provably false* (see [[Quirks]]) given the parameters.
When compiling ~foo~, it is assumed that ~expr~ is always true.  Calling the
function with parameters that do not respect ~expr~ is undefined behaviour.

~expr~ may address the function parameters by their name, or by calling them
~$n~, where ~n~ is the 0-indexed number of the parameter from left to right.

If a referenced variable is an array, it should decay into a pointer.  While it
could have allowed for more features, this would have created bug-prone behaviour
depending on whether the author of ~expr~ expected a pointer or an array.  In any
case, most problems related to the size of arrays are already solved by having
static indices in the function signature.

** Rationale
Adding more undefined behaviour in C2y might be controversial, it would certainly
not be immediately seen as ``Enabling secure programming''.

This feature is meant for cases where the developer already considers certain
parameters to be ``Undefined behaviour''.  At this point, it does not matter
whether the standard considers the code to be defined, because the results would
still be unexpected and prone to breakage.

Allowing for further optimisation is just a welcome consequence of one being able
to specify what they consider undefined behaviour.  In reality, the wanted feature is the compiler
being capable of detecting mistakes.  Function signatures using this attribute also
make the code self-documenting, which makes it easier to understand the assumptions made by the developer
when writing the function.

** Example
#+begin_src C
[[assume($1 != 0)]]
int division(int, int);

[[assume(a >= b, "Substraction requires a >= b")]]
unsigned int substract(unsigned int a, unsigned int b);

int main(void)
{
    // These compile, with no execution-time overhead.
    int result1 = division(1, 2);
    unsigned int result2 = substract(2, 3);

    // Error: "Assumption '$1 != 0' is false."
    int result3 = division(2, 0);
    // Error: "Substraction requires a >= b."
    unsigned int result4 = substract(0, 6);
}
#+end_src


** Quirks
*An assumption whose validity cannot be proven will be treated as valid.*
This should not be a problem, as this would just mean coming back to the
status quo of having to be careful as a user.
This is consistent with the way in which static array indices work in
function signatures.

Due to the way static assertions work in general, we cannot always assert
the validity of every expression.  However, in ``safer'', more restricted
styles of C, where we only work with automatic-storage-duration variables
and constant-sized arrays, this feature proves itself quite powerful already.

With C23 came more ways to define constant data, through ~constexpr~.  Assuming
it ever reaches parity with C++ ~constexpr~, or considering the possible
presence of [[https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n3600.htm][N3600]] in C2y, this feature could continue to improve over time.

* Prior implementations
There is seemingly no compiler extension allowing for this exact feature.  One
could imagine possible function-like macros being able to replicate such a
feature, but it would be non-trivial to write for functions whose return value
isn't discarded.

Even then, macros would not be ideal, as they would:
1. Allow for the library user to call the function without its underlying assumptions,
2. Make compile-time optimisations impossible,
3. Clutter the program with extraneous definitions if we have one macro per function,
4. Be incompatible with styleguides wherein parameters are unnamed in declarations,
5. Generally worsen the user experience, as macros are not always well supported
   by language servers,
6. Make the assumptions messy and hard to modify; and
7. Come with the usual points of failure of macros ([[https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/PRE31-C.+Avoid+side+effects+in+arguments+to+unsafe+macros][CERT-PRE31-C]], notably).

Indeed, it would be much more interesting for it to be a standard feature
instead of being bound by the rules of macros.

* Uncertainties
+ ``To assume'' sounds somewhat hand-wavy.  It is correct in that both the author of
  the library and the compiler are allowed to make assumptions related to function parameters,
  but ``enforce'' would better represent the purpose of the feature as a bug-preventing
  measure.  I chose ``assume'' for this paper because ``enforce'' sounded a bit violent,
  but I would be more than open to either names for the feature (and to possibly many
  other names).
